<h1>hashkitty</h1>
a lite version of a hash-cracker


<h2>Dependencies</h2>
This script is written in Python 3 and makes use of the pwntools library and the sys library. <br>
You can install pwntools by the following command: pip3 install pwntools

<h2>Usage</h2>
hashkitty is currently only capable of cracking single hashes at a time, and only hashes in the form of MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 [as of version 1.0 on 2022-10-20]. After getting the script, you can change the permissions of the .py file by the following command: chmod +x hashkitty.py <br><br>

The syntax for hashkitty requires three arguments - the .py file, the hash (the raw string not the file), and the path to your wordlist. <br>

<h2>Example</h2>
Please see the below test cases and examples of how to use hashkitty. <br><br>
